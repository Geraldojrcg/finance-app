# Finance App - The best app of finance news

## This project consists of 2 modules:
- The first module is a REST API made in Node.js and Express to scrap news from the InfoMoney site using the Puppeteer lib and saving it to an SQLite database.
- The second module is an Android app made in Kotlin. The app makes it possible to register new users and list all the news saved by the scrap, in addition, the user can read and save the news.
